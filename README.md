## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

**You will need to fork and locally clone the Ruby on Rails backend from this repository:** [MarketViz Backend](https://github.com/bblair31/marketViz_backend)

After following the README in the Backend Repo above, make sure to run `rails s` first so that Rails is running on localhost:3000


### Installing

1. Fork and clone this repository

2. Install all required packages from Node Package Manager
 
```
npm install
```

3. Change the `BASE_URL` in /marketviz-frontend/src/apis/Adapter.js from `const BASE_URL = "https://market-viz-backend.herokuapp.com/api/v1/"` to:

```
localhost:3000/api/v1
```


4. Start up the development server 

```
npm start
```

5. React should alert you to the fact that the Rails server is already running on default port `localhost:3000`. It will ask if you want to use a different port. Respond with `Y`

React should automatically open the application in your default browser and begin to load. If it does not, you will see the Local web address in terminal at which you can access the application via your browser.
